# Geonet Earth Quake Update 
### Geonet API intro work - Team work
This work was originally done in class to practice working with different apis, specifically geonet's. It was then reused to practice collabrative work in a group scenario where we were tasked to install npm and grunt tasks to help automate the making and editing of our website.

### Requirements
To view this project, you are required to use a googlemaps api key. You can get a key here: 
[Google Api Key link](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials?project=wellington-breweries&folder=&organizationId= "Google Api Key link title")
Once you have an api key:
* Create a config.json file inside of the js folder
* inside of that file:
	* Type: apiKey = '[{"key" : "your key goes here"}]'
* Then the google map should appear

### Work done in Collabaration:
* Added grunt
* Installed node modules
	* Installed bootstrap
	* Install jquery
	* Install popper.js
